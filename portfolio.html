    <p>Here is a brief summary about me, what I have been doing and how I got interested in music</p>
    <h2>General information about me</h2>
    <p>My real name is <i>Jorge Serrano PÃ©rez</i>. I was born in Madrid in 1973, and since I was born, I have always been linked in one way or another, with music.</p>
    <p>Near my house, there have been music conservatories. Friends of mine played the violin or the piano. My sister, five years older than me, took music classes, and I... I just looked... I never taught, but my education was always accompanied by music.</p>
    <p>Every time the private music teacher finished teaching my sister at home, I sat in front of the piano to play. And whenever he could, he did.</p>
