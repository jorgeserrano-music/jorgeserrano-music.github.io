With a lot of effort, you break a piece of the shell. Exhausted, you rest and try again. You finally make it out, but you can barely move after all the effort.
                After this, you decide to try to stand up and enjoy everything that surrounds it. You have a whole world ahead of you to discover</i></p>
          <p><hr>Hatching is my first song, and it represents my first small step into a new, unknown world that I have always wanted to discover and experience, and share my feelings and my thoughts, through music</p>
